query is capture from STDIN and executed on an indexed data structure
containing books' information. The result is displayed on STDOUT and outputs
the top 10 matches ordered by their tf*idf scores.

To Do
- how about remove indexing, ranking msg from start search engine.

Example #1:
    $ python index.py

    [Main] Loading books...
    [Book] Loading books from file...
    [Search] Start search engine (Indexing | Ranking)...
    [Ranking] Vocabulary assembled with terms count 230885
    [Ranking] Starting tf computation...
    [Ranking] Starting tf-idf computation...
    [Ranking] Starting tf-idf norm computation...
    [Index] Building index...
    [Index] Saving index...
    [Benchmark] Function = load_books, Time = 406.88 sec
    [Main] Done loading books, 1284904 docs in index

Example #2:
    $ python search.py
    
    Enter a query, or hit enter to quit: Alys Eyre Macklin Greuze
